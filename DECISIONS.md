## 2026-10-08 — Free LLM via an OpenAI-compatible client

**Context:** This is a portfolio project, so LLM calls should cost nothing. The dev machine (Intel Mac, 8 GB RAM) is too weak to run a useful model locally.

**Options considered:**
- Paid APIs (Anthropic, OpenAI): best quality, but they cost money.
- Local Ollama: free and private, but slow and low quality on 8 GB of RAM.
- Free hosted tiers (Groq, Google Gemini): free, fast, rate-limited.

**Decision:** Use the `openai` Python SDK against any OpenAI-compatible endpoint, configured with `LLM_BASE_URL`, `LLM_API_KEY`, `LLM_MODEL_MAIN` and `LLM_MODEL_FAST`. Default to the Groq free tier: `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` as the main model and `llama-3.1-8b-instant` as the fast one. Gemini or Ollama can be swapped in by editing `.env` alone, with no code change. Structured output uses JSON mode plus Pydantic validation, with one retry, because every one of these providers supports that.

**Eval evidence:** none yet.
